# Techpress
A web application built with MEAN stack that allows you to review and rate a certain computer technology and then the application will weight that rating based on user reputation which is computed by using certain factors.
To run the app make sure you already have latest versions of mongodb and nodejs installed on your system.
Then from the terminal visit the folder containing the application and run command 'npm install' to install  all the dependencies.
After that run 'npm start' and visit 'localhost:3000' on your browser to view the application.

Thank you!
